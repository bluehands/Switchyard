Ideas

 - Warn if method represents non existent transition
 - Warn if switch misses label
 - Non deterministic state machines 
 - move purly generated code to separate file (match methods and trigger / state union types)
 - support nested classes in UnionType and state machine refactoring
 - format with extension with whitespaces
